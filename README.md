# Vibewise
A web app that allows users to play a subsection of a selected playlist based on their mood. This mood is determined by a descriptive sentence entered by the user.


To get things running:

1) In `/flask` run `python vibe_engine.py` to get the Flask API running on your machine.
2) In `/core` (new command window/terminal) run `node server.js` to make the web app accessible at `localhost:8888`.
